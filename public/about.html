<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Emma. I love travel, adventure and learning new things.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, I moved from Manchester to Virginia with my family, and it's been a wild ride of culture changes, amazing food (I'm thinking shrimp and grits), and making a new life on this side of the pond!
I love home-cooked food, a good romantasy book, and a glass of wine at the end of the day!</p>

<p>Right now, I'm learning full-stack web development to build my business, Bumpkin & Bear Digital. I'm also starting an Etsy shop to help mums with things like planners, chore charts, and games for the kids - anything to make life a little easier!</p>
